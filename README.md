# Freightly applicant project 2020

## Project description

The applicant shall develop a real-time chat service; The functionality should include the administration of

-   chats

-   messages

-   live updates

*User management* or *Login functionality* is not required.

i.e. permission grant through user name

Storage of data does not have to be persistent but could be (e.g. different sessions in different tabs shared through localStorage). 


## Project management approach

Featured commits (git flow is not necessary, yet we would like to see more than one commit). 


## Assessment of performance

The general focus will be on backend functionality and structuredness of implementation and practice, NOT beauty.


## Technology stack

No restirctions but modern technologies are preferred.

## Expected temporal scope

max. 6h

## Addition

Otherwise, the applicant is free in her or his choice of using technologies, frameworks and patterns.  
Also, any additional complexity is not required, yet not forbidden (e.g. use of websockets).   
We are looking forward to see your creativity! :)
